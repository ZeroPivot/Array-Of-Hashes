# Array-Of-Hashes
Array Of Hashes algorithm in Ruby

Something I made to act as a simple database for my ComicMan project. TODO is making a documentation for it, but chances are there are
far better libraries out there anyways.

# Usage:
`DB = AOH.new` # to create an instance of the database that runs in memory.
`DB.load!
